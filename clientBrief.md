## Gathering Requirements

Often we'll want to just get started designing or building the thing, because that's what we do, but failing to get the requirements right leads to more change requests, scope creep, and botched jobs!

First things first, going over general requirements and asking the high-level questions about what the website's goals will be to be in relation to making the business money.

Then we can get more specific by picturing, if we had a dream website, at the end of the rainbow, what would that look like?

This is the point to ask about the budget for the project, and then I can take your dreams and hard requirements and produce a range of offers that could go from something less expensive, to something closer to what you wanted to pay, and something if you wanted to go above and beyond and all out!

After

Have a list of questions to give the client after the initial meeting. (Don't make every field required, and tell them to fill out what they can.)
